# IBM_Data_Science_Capstone_Project
Welcome to the IBM Data Science Capstone Project! This project is part of a larger initiative undertaken by a global IT and business consulting services firm. As a Data Scientist , you have been recently hired to assist with this project, leveraging your skills in data collection, analysis, and visualization.

# Project Overview
The primary goal of this project is to analyze data from various sources to identify trends and insights regarding emerging skills in the IT industry. The organization you work for is renowned for its expertise in IT solutions and has a team of highly experienced IT consultants. To remain competitive in a rapidly evolving technological landscape, your firm regularly conducts data analysis to understand future skill requirements.

# Project Tasks
Your responsibilities as a Data Scientist include:

1. Data Collection (JSON & Webscrapping)
2. Data Visualization
3. Data Wrangling
4. Exploratory Data Analysis 
4. Launch_Site_Locations (Folium)
6. Machine_Learning_Prediction

   
# Evaluation
Your performance in this capstone project will be evaluated through quizzes in each module and the final project presentation. This evaluation process ensures that you not only acquire the necessary technical skills but also demonstrate your ability to effectively communicate and visualize data-driven insights.

# Repository Structure
This repository contains the following components:

Notebooks: The data science process is divided into separate notebooks, each representing a specific step in the workflow.
Additional Files: Supplementary files are included to enhance understanding and support the notebooks.

## Applied Learning Project
This Professional Certificate has a strong emphasis on applied learning. Except for the first course, all other courses include a series of hands-on labs in the IBM Cloud that will give you **practical skills with applicability to real jobs**, including:

**Tools:** Jupyter / JupyterLab, GitHub, R Studio, and Watson Studio

**Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Folium, ipython-sql, Scikit-learn, ScipPy, etc.

**Projects:** random album generator, predict housing prices, best classifier model, battle of neighborhoods
