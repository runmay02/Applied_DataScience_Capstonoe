# IBM_Data_Science_Capstone_Project

# About this Course
This is the final course in the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate as well as the Applied Data Science with Python Specialization. This capstone project course will give you the chance to practice the work that data scientists do in real life when working with datasets.  

In this course you will assume the role of a Data Scientist working for a startup intending to compete with SpaceX, and in the process follow the Data Science methodology involving data collection, data wrangling, exploratory data analysis, data visualization, model development, model evaluation, and reporting your results to stakeholders.  

You will be tasked with predicting if the first stage of the SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket will land successfully. With the help of your Data Science findings and models, the competing startup you have been hired by can make more informed bids against SpaceX for a rocket launch.  

In this course, there will not be much new learning, instead youâ€™ll focus on hands-on work to demonstrate and apply what you have learnt in previous courses.  By successfully completing this Capstone you will have added a project to your data science and machine learning portfolio to showcase to employers.

# Project Tasks
Your responsibilities as a Data Scientist include:

1. Data Collection (JSON & Webscrapping)
2. Data Visualization
3. Data Wrangling
4. Exploratory Data Analysis 
4. Launch_Site_Locations (Folium)
6. Machine_Learning_Prediction

   
# Evaluation
Your performance in this capstone project will be evaluated through quizzes in each module and the final project presentation. This evaluation process ensures that you not only acquire the necessary technical skills but also demonstrate your ability to effectively communicate and visualize data-driven insights.

# Repository Structure
This repository contains the following components:

Notebooks: The data science process is divided into separate notebooks, each representing a specific step in the workflow.
Additional Files: Supplementary files are included to enhance understanding and support the notebooks.

## Applied Learning Project
This Professional Certificate has a strong emphasis on applied learning. Except for the first course, all other courses include a series of hands-on labs in the IBM Cloud that will give you **practical skills with applicability to real jobs**, including:

**Tools:** Jupyter / JupyterLab, GitHub, R Studio, and Watson Studio

**Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Folium, ipython-sql, Scikit-learn, ScipPy, etc.

**Projects:** random album generator, predict housing prices, best classifier model, battle of neighborhoods

# Getting Started
To begin your journey with the IBM Data Science Capstone Project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Review the provided notebooks and additional files to understand the project's workflow and requirements.
3. Set up the necessary environment, ensuring you have the required libraries and dependencies installed.
4. Proceed with each notebook in the given order, executing the code cells and following the instructions.
5. Take quizzes for each module to assess your understanding and progress.
6. Once you have completed the data analysis and visualization, prepare for the final project presentation by summarizing your key findings and recommendations.

# Acknowledgements
I would also like to extend my sincere appreciation to Coursera for offering the Data Science course that laid the foundation for this project. The course equipped me with essential knowledge and skills in data analysis, visualization, and presentation, which have been instrumental in the successful completion of this project.

Furthermore, I am deeply grateful to IBM for their contribution to this project. Leveraging IBM Cognos Science as a powerful tool for creating interactive dashboards has greatly enhanced the visualization and storytelling capabilities of the data, enabling me to present my findings in a compelling and engaging manner.

I would like to acknowledge and thank the open-source community and the developers of the libraries and tools used throughout this project. Their dedication to creating accessible and robust resources has played a significant role in the success of this capstone project.

Lastly, I would like to express my appreciation to all individuals, mentors, and organizations who have provided guidance, assistance, and support throughout this project. Your insights and feedback have been invaluable, and I am truly grateful for your contributions.
